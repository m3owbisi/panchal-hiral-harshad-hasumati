## 🔍 problem statement

Modern cybersecurity landscapes face growing threats that require adaptive, intelligent defenses. Traditional methods are often reactive, siloed, and heavily reliant on human intervention, leading to:

* escalating complexity of cyber threats and techniques
* difficulty integrating and coordinating heterogeneous security tools
* global shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals
* limited ability to simulate real-world attacks without risking live systems

**our solution:** a multi-agent AI-driven cybersecurity platform that integrates detection, defense, coordination, and offensive simulation into a unified, intelligent system.
